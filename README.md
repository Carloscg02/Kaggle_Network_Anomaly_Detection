# Kaggle_Network_Anomaly_Detection
This repository contains my solution to a Kaggle InClass competition on **anomaly detection in LTE mobile networks**.   The goal is to train ML models capable of classifying cell activity as **normal (0)** or **unusual (1)**, based on traffic traces collected from a real LTE deployment.
